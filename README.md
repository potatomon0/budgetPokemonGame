Hello,

this is an attempt to create a Pokemon like game using all the knowledge learned from the course so far while learning some more with internet research throughout the process.

How the game works:
Player would click start button and options such as: encounter, shop, map buttons, and reset button will be available.

If the player chose to encounter, a random wild pokemon from the map pool would generate. Each map has their own set of possible pokemon.

If the player click on a map button, the background/scene would change along with the possible pokemon that can appear.

Shop button is in the works.

Reset button brings player back to the "Start Game" page and erase all achievement ($ gained and pkm caught).

Player start out with Pikachu as the default team pokemon. Pikachu has Thunderbolt and Iron Tail skillset. The wild pokemon will attack back with one of it's own move.

If the player's pokemon is defeated, then it's game over.

If the player's pokemon defeat the wild pokemon, player gain $$$ and click confirm to go back to encounter-map button-shop-reset- page.

Features in mind to be implemented:
Speed: decides which pokemon get to attack first
Exp/lv up: if player defeat or catches a pokemon, player pokemon level up and all stats increase
Shop: buy pokemon or potion to recover pokemon hp
Pokeball: catch wild pokemon, the success rate will be determined by the remaining wild pokemon's hp
Pokemon storage:caught pokemon will be pushed into the pokemon storage array, pokemon can be swapped from team to storage and back with push/pop(?)

Take away from doing this project:
I tried to use as much of the knowledge I learned as possible. This project can be considered an improved version of the "Save the Universe" mini project. I chose pokemon for the turn base and object/sequence oriented game operation because I had a hunch it will bring my understanding of JS, HTML, and CSS to a new level. I love organizing the objects/arrays and calling to it. It was oddly satisfying when I was able to get the element I need from the nested object/array. I'm starting to wonder if I prefer to work with backend.

I started forming my coding habit during this project. I find it much easier if I did the wireframe and show the container of each part of the game and buttons. It is easier to visualize the interaction of the buttons and logic behind player actions. I also like to organize my code, such as declaration with declaration and functions with functions. So my list goes: Class --> declaration --> functions. I also came up with snippet testing which is copy and pasting a small portion of the code (like a function) on a separate js file for testing. This way it is finding 1 line of error form maybe 10 lines instead of 300+ lines.

I learned not to panick, calm my brain and work through the logic. It can be burdening with a clock (due date) ticking on the side but panick does not acheiev anything. With this mindset, I was able to work through each feature of the game bit by bit.
